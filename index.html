        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Tsinat Mekonnen, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at Addis Ababa University. I have always been passionate about technology, coding, and problem-solving, which led me to pursue a degree in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. My studies at one of the leading universities in Ethiopia have equipped me with a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, data structures, and the core principles of computing.

            Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that have strengthened my skills in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C++. One of the most rewarding experiences has been my involvement in web development, where I have created interactive web applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly. I am particularly interested in areas like artificial intelligence, data science, and cybersecurity, and I actively seek opportunities to explore these fields further.</p>
